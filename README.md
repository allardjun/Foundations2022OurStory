# Foundations of Systems Biology Short Course 2022

## Let's write a short story!

A group activity where we each edit a line of the poem or short story.

The activity:

We will spend about 5 minutes on each step. If you get lost or something doesn't work, you can still follow along, and later tonight try again as if you were Tier 1.

1. Generate a random number using [www.google.com/search?q=random+number+generator](https://www.google.com/search?q=random+number+generator). If it is less than 5, you are in Tier 1. If it is greater than 5, you are in Tier 2. 

2. If you are in Tier 1, fork this repo from allardjun. The "Fork" button is at top-right.

3. If you are in Tier 2, wait a minute for the Tier 1 fork to show up. Then, click the number to the right of the "Fork" button. You will see a list of Tier 1 students who have forked it from allardjun. Fork the repo from one of them. 

4. Everyone: Make sure you are in  *your* repo. The URL and the title should say `[your username]/Foundations2022OurStory`, and not `[someone else's username]/Foundations2022OurStory`. Then, 

    - Click the file `main.tex`. 
    - Click the edit button, which is a pencil icon at the right of the screen, between a monitor icon and a trash icon.
    - Edit a line in the poem to say whatever you want (this will be public).

6. Under "Commit changes", write a brief description of your edit, and then click the big green button to "Commit changes".

7. If you are Tier 2: Make a Pull Request. 

     - Click "Pull Request" tab in the horizontal tab list,
     - Click "New Pull Request" green button on right of the screen.
     - Create Pull Request

8. If you are Tier 1: Accept & Merge the Pull Requests from Tier 2. 

9. If you are Tier 1: Make a Pull Request. 

     - Click "Pull Request" tab in the horizontal tab list,
     - Click "New Pull Request" green button on right of the screen.
